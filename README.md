# SPREADNET

SpreadNet is a program written in C, trying to ressemble a self replicating virus.
It goes through all the files in a given directory and infects *.bat*, *.exe*, and *.txt*.

Keep in mind this was written a long time ago when I did not know how to program... and **do not execute on your own computer** it will probably destroy it.

### [Goes through every directory on Comp]:
- copies itself if does not exist
- edits files in directory
